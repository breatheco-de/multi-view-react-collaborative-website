Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, react-router, react context.

![Preview](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-multi-view-react-collaborative-website/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

Enough with the landing pages and single view projects, it is time to build our first web app. 

This is a collaborative project, the class will be separated in groups and each will create a piece of a multi-view website.

## ðŸŒ±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository.

1. We recommend opening cloning the [React.js Advanced boilerplate](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp) using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to clone and open:

```txt
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp
```

**ðŸ‘‰ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).


If working locally, type the following command to clone from your command line: `git clone https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello-webapp`.

2. Invite the other students as collaborators.

3. All the students clone the repository.

4. Divide the project workload into pieces and each group starts working on its piece, 2 or max 3 people per group.

5. Install the dependencies `$ npm install`

6. Start the WebPack development server: `$ npm run start`


Done!

### This project is meant to be done in two phases

#### Phase 1: set the views. React Router.

Each group will have to create the corresponding ***view component*** with dummy content (initially) and as many "smaller" components as needed.

Note: Think DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and declare only ***one*** component and use `props` to handle different content.

#### Phase 2: make the app dynamic. React Context.

Each group must use the Consumer given by the instructor in order to ***use the store to fill the content*** of the pieces:

- Navbar: must show the user's username and picture (assume the user is logged in).
- Login: show the login form.
- Landing Page: must show 3 posts in the carousel, 3 posts in a grid, and 3 products in the products section.
- Blog: must show 6 blog posts
- Post View: must show clicked post details.

##### Using the Context

The `store` structure:

```javascript
store = {
    posts:[
        {
            title: 'This is a World Post',
            content: 'Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old.

        ...
    ]
};
```

In order to have access to the global data, you'll have to import the context's main file: 

```jsx
import {Context} from '/path/to/store/appContext.jsx';

const MyView = () => {
    const { actions, store } = useContext(Context);
    //Then use the Consumer anywhere on the component
    return (<span> hello, {store.session.username} </span>);
}
```

Hint: you can see an example of the `Context.Consumer` in action at: 

```txt
demo.jsx
 - demoList.jsx
 - demoProducts.jsx
```
